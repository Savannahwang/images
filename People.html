              <p class="w3-large">Wong (2017b) reported that Facebook is facing a severe charge regarding its role in increasing the fight between the Rohingya Muslim minority, and the Buddhists in Myanmar. The Buddhist nationalist group in Myanmar view the Rohingy as terrorists so the Buddhist nationalist group has to protect themselves against Muslim. Until now, thousands of Rohingya Muslims have been killed. Also, other countries also have noticed and tried to figure out what happened while residents have tried to use social media outlet to let the outside world hear their difficulties.</p>
              <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">During the war, the international human rights group said that Facebook has the responsibility to prevent violent speech which could put minority groups in crisis or could trigger conflict between two communities.</p>

             <h5 class="w3-center">Social media outlets provide a fair and free channel to minorities or communities, even though posts may see controversial and even deadly</h5>
             <p class="w3-large">In 2011, Nevaer (2011) reported that the civil society used social media outlets against the drug cartels, a criminal organization for supplying drug trafficking. A few days later, a man and a woman were hung from the bridge in the city of Nuevo Laredo. One of the bodies was painted with the message, “This will happen to all the Internet snitches” (Nevaer, 2011). Mexico is one of the most violent countries around the world. Even though many Mexican television networks reported the news, no journalist was willing to investigate the cases related to the cartels too deeply. However, Mexican residents tried to take their state back by spreading facts on Facebook or Twitter. And, it worked. The cartels had to kill two citizens to show their power and anger; however, the cartels were afraid of social media (Nevaer, 2011). </p>
